This folder contains the files (matlab and julia) for Project 3 (1D Burgers Equation) in the book
"An Introduction to Element-based Galerkin Methods on Tensor-Product Bases: Analysis, Algorithms, and Applications"
by Francis X. Giraldo

The directories:
For_Instructors contains the project solution and
For_Students contains the files that the students should have in order to do the project.

No PDF file with instructions is given because this could be used as either a 2nd part to Project 2 or Project 3.

You can reach the author by writing to him at frank.giraldo@gmail.com
